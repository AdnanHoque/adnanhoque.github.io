# VSCode Settings

First, edit the settings.json file for VSCode. For Linux, do the following:

~~~
nano $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
~~~

Add the following line: 

~~~
"docker.host":"ssh://username@ip-address"
~~~

The equivalent file in macOS can be found at:

~~~
$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
~~~

# Local Docker settings

Now, to point docker at your remote machine, do the following.

~~~
docker context create machine-name --docker "host=ssh://username@ip-address"
~~~

Finally open up a new terminal, switch your docker context and start a container.

~~~
docker context use machine-name
docker start container_name
~~~

If everything went well, the left hand panel of VSCode (assuming the Docker extension is installed) should reflect the containers, images and volumes of the remote machine. You should now be able to attach to any running containers within VSCode in a new tab.
